The goal of this assignment is to leverage multiple web application technologies to build a
dynamic application. This application provides a web-based frontend for a fictional geocache
database. A geocache is typically a small container, planted at a location referenced by its
latitude/longitude. The activity called geocaching is where participants attempt to locate these
containers using GPS. The general location of some geocaches are given by latitude/longitude
coordinates, but the exact placement of a cache may be discovered by solving a riddle or
puzzle. There are tons of these things hidden everywhere and itâ€™s a fun way to explore new
places.
